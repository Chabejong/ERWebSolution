1. Project Overview & Objective
We need a new, professional website for our company, E&R Webservice. The primary goal is to serve as a central hub to acquire new clients by showcasing our services in web app design, website development, and hosting services. Our target audience includes companies, small businesses, and associations.
The site must be modern, clean, trustworthy, and easy to navigate. I will provide the company logo.
2. Sitemap & Navigation Structure
The main navigation should be a horizontal top menu bar with the following pages and structure:
•	Home
•	Service
•	Reference (Showcase of past projects)
•	Partner
•	Contact
•	Company (This item must have a dropdown menu)
	About Us
	History
	News & Press
3. Page-Specific Requirements
Home Page:
•	Header: A static photo gallery (a sliding carousel) should be the first visual element. This will serve as the main banner/hero section. We will provide the high-quality images.
•	Body: The main body of the homepage should also feature a separate, integrated static photo gallery (e.g., a grid of 4-6 images) to showcase our work, team, or technology. This section should be visually distinct from the header gallery. It should bee design into three different sections, each with write up and photo.
•	Content should include a clear value proposition, brief introduction to our three core services, and prominent calls-to-action (e.g., "Get a Quote," "View Our Services").
Service Page:
•	Dedicated sections for our three core offerings:
1.	Web App Design
2.	Website Development
3.	Hosting Services
•	Each section should have a brief description and a link to learn more (could link to sub-pages later).
Reference Page:
•	A portfolio/gallery to display case studies, client logos, and links to live projects.
Company Dropdown Pages:
•	About Us: Company mission, vision, and team bios.
•	History: A timeline or narrative of our company's journey.
•	News & Press: A blog-style layout for company announcements, articles, and press releases.
Contact Page:
•	A simple contact form (Name, Email, Company, Message).
•	Our full company address, phone number, and email address displayed clearly.
4. Technical & Design Requirements
•	Design: Clean, modern, and professional. Use the provided logo as the starting point for the design style. The color scheme should be corporate yet approachable.
•	Responsiveness: The website must be fully responsive and function flawlessly on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
•	Performance: Fast loading times are critical. Optimize images and code.
•	CMS: Please build it on a content management system (like WordPress) so we can easily update the "News & Press" section and other text/content in the future.
•	SEO: The codebase should be structured with best practices for SEO (clean URLs, proper heading tags, meta tags, alt text for images, etc.).
5. Assets Provided
•	E&R Webservice Logo (in multiple formats)
•	Copy and text content for all pages.
•	High-quality images for the header and body galleries on the homepage.
